## Host App Concept

Host App is a members-only app for artists with hidden organizational logic.

### Cohort Logic

- Every 100 applications creates one independent cohort
- Application order is fixed once written (immutable)
- Prime positions within the cohort (2,3,5,7,...,97) determine selected users
- Team A: positions 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37 (12 users)
- Team B: positions 41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89 (12 users)
- Hidden Leader: position 97 (1 user, appears as normal member outwardly)
- Non-prime positions: peripheral users with restricted access

### Role Types

1. **Applicant** - submitted profile, awaits status
2. **Team Member** (Team A or B) - placed in team room
3. **Hidden Leader** - position 97, extra permissions but appears normal
4. **Peripheral User** - restricted anonymous access
5. **Admin** - external operator with full access

### Status Labels (never reveal selection rule)

- "Assigned Participant" (team member)
- "Provisional Member" (leader)
- "Restricted Access Participant" (peripheral)
- "Further Instructions Pending" (unassigned)

## DB Schema

Tables: `users`, `cohorts`, `applications`, `cohort_roles`, `rooms`, `room_members`, `messages`, `instructions`

## API Routes

- `GET /api/healthz` - Health check
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Current user
- `POST /api/auth/register` - Register
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Login
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Logout
- `POST /api/applications` - Submit application
- `GET /api/applications` - Get my application
- `GET /api/applications/all` - All applications (admin)
- `GET /api/cohorts` - All cohorts (admin)
- `GET /api/cohorts/current` - Open cohort status
- `POST /api/cohorts/:id/process` - Process cohort (admin)
- `GET /api/my-role` - My role assignment
- `GET /api/rooms` - My accessible rooms (sorted: general first, then member channels by number)
- `POST /api/rooms` - Create a member channel (name required, auto-assigns channel number)
- `GET /api/rooms/:id/messages` - Room messages (no auto-expiry, all messages persist)
- `POST /api/rooms/:id/messages` - Send message
- `DELETE /api/rooms/:roomId/messages/:messageId` - Delete own message
- `GET /api/instructions` - My instructions
- `POST /api/instructions` - Create instruction (admin)
- `GET /api/admin/stats` - Admin stats
- `POST /api/storage/uploads/request-url` - Request presigned GCS upload URL (auth required)
- `GET /api/storage/objects/*` - Serve stored media objects
- `GET /api/storage/public-objects/*` - Serve public assets

## Media Messaging

Members can send photos, voice messages, and short videos in rooms. All identities remain hidden.

- **Photo**: getUserMedia → canvas capture → JPEG blob → presigned URL upload → message with `mediaType: "image"`
- **Voice**: MediaRecorder → auto-detected MIME (webm/mp4/ogg) → presigned URL upload → message with `mediaType: "audio"`
- **Video**: getUserMedia (video+audio) → MediaRecorder with 20s limit → presigned URL upload → message with `mediaType: "video"`
- **Captions**: optional text alongside media
- **Delete**: users can delete their own messages via `DELETE /api/rooms/:roomId/messages/:messageId`
- **Persistence**: messages are stored indefinitely (no auto-expiry). Members can manually delete their own messages.
- **Object storage**: Replit App Storage (GCS bucket), presigned PUT URLs, served back via `/api/storage/objects/*` with Range request support
- **Audio playback**: BlobAudioPlayer component fetches audio as blob, detects format from magic bytes (MP4/WebM/OGG), creates blob URL for reliable playback
- **Playback modes**: Toggle between SINGLE (one echo at a time, manual) and CONTINUOUS (echoes chain automatically — when one ends, the next media message starts). "PLAY ALL" starts from the first echo in continuous mode.
- **Web Audio API engine**: All audio routed through Web Audio API graph: source → distortion (waveshaper) → delay (feedback loop) → gain → analyser → destination. Enables real-time sonic manipulation.
- **FX panel**: Expandable effects rack with four knobs: SPEED (0.25x–2x playback rate), CRUSH (waveshaper distortion 0–100), DELAY (0–1s), FEEDBACK (0–90%). Three presets: HAUNTED (slow/distorted/wet), CRUSHED (fast/harsh), SUBMERGED (slow/deep echo).
- **Waveform visualizer**: Canvas-based real-time waveform + frequency spectrum with anaglyphic blue/red dual-trace rendering, random glitch slice displacement, and jitter artifacts.
- **Ambient drone**: Generative low-frequency oscillator layer (3 detuned oscillators + LFO modulation + stereo panning). Intensity scales with message count in room. Activatable via AMBIENT/DRONE toggle.
- **Glitch transitions**: 600ms corrupted transition effect between echoes in continuous mode — brightness/contrast/hue-rotate/blur/skew animation during crossover.
- **Glitch effects**: When media plays, the feed activates visual glitch effects — ambient jitter, scanline overlay, RGB split on playing messages, corrupt text effects.
- **Echo states**: Playing messages get blue/red depth border glow, text corruption animation, and the message card flickers subtly. Images in the feed shift to luminosity blend mode during playback.

## Member Channels

- **General channel**: system-created, permanent, all cohort members auto-join. Pinned at top of dashboard.
- **Member channels**: any cohort member can create a named channel via `POST /api/rooms` with `{ name: "..." }`. Channel numbers are assigned sequentially. All existing cohort members are auto-added to new channels.
- **Dashboard layout**: General pinned at top, member-created channels listed below with left-border indent. "New Channel" button at bottom.
- **Room types**: `general`, `member_channel`, plus system types (`team_a`, `team_b`, `leader`, `peripheral`, `admin_broadcast`)
- **DB columns on rooms**: `display_name` (text, nullable), `channel_number` (integer, nullable), `created_by_user_id` (integer, nullable FK to users)

## Anonymous Identity System

- Each member has a persistent `maskedLabel` per room stored in `room_members.masked_label`
- Labels format: `ADJECTIVE-NOUN-###` (e.g. `SILENT-CONDUIT-487`)
- Assigned when user joins a room; backfilled automatically on first message if missing
- Displayed as sender identity in all messages — user IDs never exposed

## Cohort Engine (`artifacts/api-server/src/lib/cohort-engine.ts`)

The prime-based selection logic. When admin calls `POST /api/cohorts/:id/process`:
1. Assigns roles based on application order
2. Creates 5 room types: team_a, team_b, leader, peripheral, admin_broadcast
3. Adds users to appropriate rooms based on their role
4. Locks the cohort and marks applications as assigned
